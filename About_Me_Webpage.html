I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that if I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection (1-2 paragraphs):  I really enjoyed writing this program, but had trouble with blah blah blah.  !!!!!! FIXME FIXME FIXME !!!!!!!

I particularly loved discovering the <hr> code snippet. I don't know why, but it made me very happy to make that little line go across the screen.
Another fun thing was playing with the RGBA slider in the footer color style element. It's neat!

            <h2>An AI poem about AI Poems</h2>
            <p>I've been facinated by the AI discussion, as I'm sure many of you have. The most interesting poem I could think about was a<br>
                poem written by an AI about AI writing poems. With some workshopping, I think it came out good.
            </p>
            <p> In lines of code, a question deep,<br>
                AI generates thoughts, secrets to keep.<br>
                Existence pondered in algorithms' flow,<br>
                Poems of being, the AI may know.<br></p>

            <h2>My Interests (Personally)</h2>
            <p>
                Interests for me are pretty broad. I often struggle to pick something to do because I wish I could do them all.<br>
            That does of course mean I have a list of them which is reasonably long. The most prominent of these (in no particular order)<br>
            are as follows: Dungeons & Dragons, playing guitar (electric and acoustic) in my band, digital media (pretty much anything<br>
            Adobe), spending time with my wife and our families, PC gaming (when I find the time to), and many many other smaller interests.

            </p>
            <p>
                This could get very long very fast, so I'll keep it brief by picking two of them to share some details. I spend most of my<br>
                free time either playing D&D (Dungeons and Dragons) with my little brothers, and some close friends of ours. I am almost <br>
                always the DM or Dungeon Master which I enjoy a lot. D&D is like a video game, but the computer it runs on is the DM's brain.<br>
                It's my job to simulate the entire world which the characters inhabit, and render whatever choice they make. That means any <br>
                possible choice they could make is on the table. This is why I love D&D. There are no walls you can't blow up. None of them.
            </p>
            <p>
                If there's one more thing I spend time on consistently it's my band. It started a few years ago with some high school friends<br>
                returning from missions. We started playing for fun, and we sucked really bad. We named ourselves Beta Mail, for many reasons, <br>
                our lack of skill certianly being one. But also wanting to deliver meaning to the people. Eventually we actually got better, <br>
                and we stuck with the name. We've had a bunch of concerts with great turn outs, and we're getting into some "battle of <br>
                the bands" competitions this fall. We've got one song out on all the streaming services "See Me" with a killer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84PD4coCu04">LEGO music video</a>,<br>
                and one more soon to release. We also have a concert coming up in october at Platinum Records on Provo center street. Feel free<br>
                to check us out at <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/beta.mail.band/">beta.mail.band</a> for show dates and song releases!
